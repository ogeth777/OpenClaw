# OpenClaw: BNB Autonomous Agent 🤖💎

> **Winner of BNB Chain Hackathon (The Hand Track)** & **Fairathon Participant**

OpenClaw is an advanced autonomous AI agent that manages DeFi portfolios on BNB Chain through a natural language terminal interface. Built with the "OODA Loop" architecture (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act), it moves beyond simple chatbots to become a true on-chain actor.
